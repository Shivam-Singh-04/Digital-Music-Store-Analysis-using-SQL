# Digital-Music-Store-Analysis-using-SQL

The objective of this project was to learn to analyze the dataset with SQL and help the store understand its business growth by answering some of their questions related to the business. In this project, I have used PostgreSQL Server and pgAdmin4 (Open Source management tool for Postgres).



🌐 Why PostgreSQL:

PostgreSQL's reputation for reliability, extensibility, and strong support for complex queries makes it an ideal choice for our data analysis needs. Also, it offers data types that MySQL does not, as well as many other features that are not offered in MySQL.



Though it did not provide the common graphics used for data visualization  such as charts, plots, infographics, bars, etc. but was able to answer most of the simple and complex queries through it's output as shown in the images below.



🔍 What We're Analyzing:

● Customer purchasing behavior

● Most popular genres and artists

● Geographic trends in music preferences

● Seasonal variations in music choices

● User engagement metrics
